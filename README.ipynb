    "# Data Science Mini Projects\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains five small-scale machine learning and data analysis projects focusing on data exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling. Each task uses a real-world dataset and applies relevant techniques to achieve the objective.\n",

    "\n",
    "## **Task 1: Exploring and Visualizing the Iris Dataset**\n",
    "### **Objective**\n",
    "Understand how to read, summarize, and visualize a dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Approach**\n",
    "- Loaded dataset using `pandas` and inspected it using `.shape`, `.columns`, `.head()`.\n",
    "- Created:\n",
    "  - **Scatter Plot** to analyze variable relationships.\n",
    "  - **Histogram** to examine feature distribution.\n",
    "  - **Box Plot** to detect outliers and spread.\n",
    "- Used `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Results & Insights**\n",
    "- Clear separation observed between some iris species in petal dimensions.\n",
    "- Setosa species forms a distinct cluster compared to Versicolor and Virginica.\n",
    "- Minimal outliers present.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## **Task 2: Credit Risk Prediction**\n",
    "### **Objective**\n",
    "Predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Approach**\n",
    "- Loaded Kaggle Loan Prediction dataset.\n",
    "- Handled missing values with median/mode imputation.\n",
    "- Performed EDA on loan amount, education, and applicant income.\n",
    "- Trained **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree** classifiers.\n",
    "- Evaluated models using **Accuracy** and **Confusion Matrix**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Results & Insights**\n",
    "- Decision Tree achieved slightly higher accuracy (~78%) compared to Logistic Regression (~75%).\n",
    "- Education level and applicant income strongly influenced default likelihood.\n",
    "- Most defaults occurred among applicants with lower incomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Task 3: Customer Churn Prediction**\n",
    "### **Objective**\n",
    "Identify customers likely to leave the bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Approach**\n",
    "- Cleaned dataset and encoded categorical variables:\n",
    "  - Geography (One-Hot Encoding)\n",
    "  - Gender (Label Encoding)\n",
    "- Trained **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest Classifier**.\n",
    "- Analyzed feature importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Results & Insights**\n",
    "- Random Forest achieved ~86% accuracy.\n",
    "- Key factors influencing churn:\n",
    "  - Number of products\n",
    "  - Customer tenure\n",
    "  - Balance\n",
    "- Customers with lower tenure and fewer products were more likely to leave.\n",

    "## **Task 4: Predicting Insurance Claim Amounts**\n",
    "### **Objective**\n",
    "Estimate medical insurance charges based on personal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Approach**\n",
    "- Trained a **Linear Regression** model on the Medical Cost dataset.\n",
    "- Visualized relationships between BMI, age, smoking status, and charges.\n",
    "- Evaluated model performance using **MAE** and **RMSE**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Results & Insights**\n",
    "- MAE ≈ 4100, RMSE ≈ 6000.\n",
    "- Smokers and higher BMI individuals had significantly higher charges.\n",
    "- Age also positively correlated with charges.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Task 5: Personal Loan Acceptance Prediction**\n",
    "### **Objective**\n",
    "Predict which customers will accept a personal loan offer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Approach**\n",
    "- Explored dataset focusing on age, job type, and marital status.\n",
    "- Trained **Logistic Regression** and **Decision Tree** classifiers.\n",
